# ADVENT-OF-CODE-2023
My resolution of the **[Advent of Code](adventofcode.com)** of 2023, mostly in **[Python](https://www.python.org/)**, using easy way to show new programmers way to do it even without being at a high programming level. 

Why make it complicated when you can make it simple ? :)


**------------------------------------------------**

- My IDE (Integrated Development Environment, = programming editor) is  **[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)**, wich I consider useful for new programmers since it has highlights and color schemes that are easily understandable and
help a lot understanding a language's syntax, especially Python.

- If you're stuck somewhere in your code, not finding where is the problem, I suggest that you start to use **[Python Tutor](https://pythontutor.com/visualize.html#mode=edit)**
  wich executes a code line by line and graphically shows you what it does.

<3 | I'd like to give my thanks to @kewanfr for giving me the idea of making a GitHub Project out of it.

If you're interested in the way I've done things, or you would like to learn about programming, whether it's at a high or beginner level
